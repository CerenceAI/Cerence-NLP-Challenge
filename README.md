# Submission Repository

This repository contains the final submission for the technical challenge. The contents of this repository are licensed under [proprietary license](LICENSE).

My Cerence NLP Challenge solution extends a JSGF grammar and localizes it to Korean. The minimal dependency approach meets the task requirements and allows for future improvements. The code is easy to understand and extend, with a report suggesting advanced techniques, such as pre-trained language models and neural architectures.

## Contents

- `wonhyeongseo.zip.asc`: Encrypted zip file containing final reports, code, generated utterances, and CV.

2. Retrieve the passphrase from the candidate.
3. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   gpg --decrypt wonhyeongseo.zip.asc > pdfs.zip
   ```

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `wonhyeongseo.zip.asc` file is saved.
5. Enter the passphrase when prompted and press Enter.
